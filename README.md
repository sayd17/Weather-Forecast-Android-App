# WeatherForecast-Android-App
This is a simple android app using API

Specal thanks to my teammates **Abdus Sahid** and **Abu Sayeed**. It was our team project at 2nd year.

Introduction:

Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century.
Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change.

Purpose:

The purpose of developing weather app is to fetch the data in the need of taking information about weather worldwide. Another purpose for developing this software is to generate the report automatically at the end of the session or in the between of the session.
Why we build or people will use this app?
Suppose, you're sleeping in your living room and try to dry up your cloths on the roof top.What, if your cloths get wet by rain? This is a sad situation for you. So, if our app alerts you before happening rain it may be very useful for you.
